# Sustainable Coffee Production Analysis - TFM Project

This repository contains the code and resources for my Master's Thesis Project (TFM) in collaboration with Progreso and Beyco, focusing on improving sustainable coffee production.

## Project Overview

This project uses geospatial data analysis to identify overlaps between coffee farming regions supported by Progreso in Colombia and areas experiencing deforestation. It aims to create a scalable framework to help Progreso assess environmental risks, comply with EU regulations, and promote sustainable coffee production.

For more details about the project, you can read the official article: [https://www.progreso.nl/students-from-eae-business-school-barcelona-collaborate-with-progreso-beyco-to-improve-sustainable-coffee-production/](https://www.progreso.nl/students-from-eae-business-school-barcelona-collaborate-with-progreso-beyco-to-improve-sustainable-coffee-production/)
